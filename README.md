# EffIt
Repository for info on the EffIt machine. NSFW.

A screw based thrusting machine that operates similar to a typical electric cylinder. Done with parts on hand, not optimized. T10, 20mm lead screw with a 2.5nM motor provides excessive torque, but limited top speed. A 50mm lead is faster while still providing plenty of power.

The linear bearing prevents rotation by accident, not design. Putting a small slip between the nut and frame prevents rotation without needing to implement an entire guide.
